# Biome Name Fix

You may have noticed that when you play with datapacks that add biomes e.g. Terralith, that mods like Xaero's minimap, Journeymap, MiniHUD and other mods that read biome names have untranslated strings, often looking something like 'biome.namespace.biomename', which is not all that pretty.

This tool fixes that by generating a lang file that you can use in the /assets/minecraft/lang folder of a resourcepack or mod.

If you wish to make fixes for multiple packs, you can use https://weld.smithed.dev to make a combined pack and then stick it back in here.
