# Biome Name Fix

When using datapacks that add new biomes, you may notice that mods such as Xaero's Minimap, Journeymap, and MiniHUD display untranslated biome names as 'biome.namespace.biomename,' which isn't very pretty.

This tool solves that issue by generating a language file that you can place in a [resource pack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack#Language) or mod. If you're working with multiple packs, you can use [Weld](https://weld.smithed.dev) to create a combined pack and then process it with this tool.
